# EECS E6893 Big Data Analytics Final Project: Credit Card Fraud detection via Cluster based Scoring & Anomaly Detection

Team Members: Vedant Kumar (vrk2109), Siddharth Nijhawan (sn2951), Sushant Tiwari (st3425)

## Description

The repository contains 4 jupyter notebooks containing end-to-end pipelines of implementing various iterative and clustering based anomaly detection algorithms on the dataset of Credit Card Fraud Detection 

Dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

1. data_analysis.ipynb - performs initial data analysis by generating statistical metrics for each feature dimension like mean, std, min-max values, etc. Notebook also generates histograms for each feature vector and plots correlation heatmap as well

2. kmeans.ipynb - 

## Usage



```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
